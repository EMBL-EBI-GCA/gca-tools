Generate a file manifest for submitting to GCA at EMBL-EBI

This script generates a file manifest for files that you want to submit to GCA
at EMBL-EBI. The script takes a list of directories or files to add to the
manifest. The default directory is your current working directory.

We recommend you gather the files you want to submit into a single directory,
and then write the output from this script to a file so that you can send it to
GCA at EMBL-EBI.
  ./file-manifest /path/to/directory > manifest.tsv

Please read your manifest before you send it to EMBL-EBI to confirm that it
contains only the files you wish to send to us.

This script is a wrapper for the following unix command. You may prefer to copy
and paste this command as an alternative to running this bash script:
  find -type f -printf '%p\t%s\t' -execdir sh -c 'md5sum {} | sed s/\ .*//'  \;
